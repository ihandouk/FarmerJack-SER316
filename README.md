Farmer Jack

 Is an application that is going to be based on three Design Patterns: Iterator, Factory, and Mediator. The goal of the farm is to gain more currency every cycle based on productivity. Farmer Jack will have an animal farm, Crop farm, and Fish farm. Animal farms will include Cows, Horses, and Sheep. Crop farm will have farmer produce a massive amount of crop; such as Coffee beans, Apples, and oranges. The Fish farm will have Lobster, Salmon, and SwordFish. The Fish farm will have several pool for every type of fish. The first cycle will begin by introducing each farm, and it will randomly choose an animal, a fish, and a crop. The simulation will move on to check if the products produced by each farm are old enough to produce. If an animal is younger then 3 cycles, the simulation will move on from it, until it grows based 3 cycles. Once an animal is older than three cycles, the animal will start producing to support the production of the farm. The simulation will go on, showing each product being sold by each farm. Each farm will sell products randomly, and at the end of each cycle, the simulation will calculate the total amount of money earned by the farms. Once the farm reaches a total of $1200 or more, the simulation will end, saying that "The farms' vault is at a maximum capacity."
